## Editing
Editing documents for typos, length, and tone. Make it warmer. Make it more professional. Fix grammatical and spelling errors.
## Summarization
Summarize long Slack threads or documents to send to people.
## Writing
Not for a final draft, but for a first draft. 1 minute, 5 minute, and 10 minute versions of speeches. Boilerplate for emails.
## Language Tutor
Learning a foreign language. Ask Claude to be conversation partner and speak only in a foreign language, except when giving the definition of a word. Give boundaries of what you want Claude to ask about. Claude can correct answers in between conversation turns.
## Calorie Counting
You can give Claude a general rundown of what you ate and Claude can give a decent approximation of the calorie breakdown.
