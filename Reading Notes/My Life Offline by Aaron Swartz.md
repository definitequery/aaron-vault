description: A blog post from the late Aaron Swartz on reflections after spending 30 days offline.
---
Aaron says that 30 days offline felt like six months, describing a change in his habits, lifestyle, hygiene, and overall mood. He describes his life as a bundle of distractions, notifications, jobs, and requests; and how he knows this way of life is unhealthy for him. He never knew how unhealthy his habits were though until he took time away from it all. He describes feeling not just happy, but *firmly* happy. He describes his state of flow offline, being better able to focus and less forces tugging on him like a life online. He finishes with this paragraph:

> *"I don’t know how I’m going to carve a life away from the world’s constant demands and distractions. I don’t know how I’m going to balance all the things I want to do with the pressures and responsibilities they bring. But after my month off, I do know one thing: I can’t go on like this. So I’m damn well going to try."*
