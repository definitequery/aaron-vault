Niko McCarty wrote some advice for finding writing ideas in a Substack post.
1. Be a thoughtful consumer. Read a lot. Treat your reading list like a river, not a bucket. Don't beat yourself up for not being able to read everything. Just try to read something and pick out the nuggets of wisdom. Give yourself time to think about what you read.
2. Treat idea discovery as a key part of the writing process. Keep up with papers and the latest ideas in fields you care about. When you have ideas, write them down.
3. Talk to lots of people.
4. Write about what you bring up in conversation.
5. Follow up on brief mentions and rhetorical questions.
6. Writing a lot, at least a little every day. Writing more makes you search for ideas more. When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
7. Share your ideas publicly.
8. Un-censor yourself. Err on the side of publishing, even if you're skeptical.
9. Ask "what if?"

"If you're reading for pleasure, and it's not pleasurable, put the book down. Give the author 50 pages, and if they haven't made it worth your time, move on to the next book."
