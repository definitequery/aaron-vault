## How to Use This List

1. **Weight by domain expertise.** Even foxes have blind spots.
2. **Read the footnotes.** Transparent reasoning is more valuable than confident headlines.
3. **Track who updates.** Look for people who change their mind with evidence.
4. **Triangulate across thinkers.** Disagreements often point to useful model assumptions.
