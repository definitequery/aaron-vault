[The Armchair Economist](https://www.amazon.com/Armchair-Economist-Economics-Everyday-Life/dp/1451651732)
This book basically teaches you the first quarter of Micro 101 at a popular, easily-accesible level. He skimps out on market failures but will teach you classic "applied price theory." This should be read first, because it helps to get a good handle on what economists usually do before branching out into the specifics of different subfields.

[Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell](http://amzn.to/1mDqfvD)
This is a broad introduction to all economic concepts, from a very pro-free-market perspective (a perspective I find to be largely correct). If you know nothing about economics, or have never read a proud defense of capitalism and free markets, then this is a good place to start.

[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre](https://archive.org/details/JesseLivermoreReminiscencesOfAStockOperator)
Fictionalized memoir of trader Jesse Livermore from the 1920s. This book is an entertaining read and it contains timeless lessons about the psychology of markets. But keep in mind that Lefèvre ultimately lost his fortune – so do not use him as a how-to guide.

[Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://amzn.to/1Lw6RFx)
A book of incredible breadth, covering everything from economics to lifestyle choices to urban planning to technology. His central framework of trying to identify situations with convex outcomes (for good or bad) is extremely useful. Note that this is far from a perfect book. His tone can be annoying and smug and his advice sometimes seems more on the side of being self-serving, convenient, or simplistic rather than being completely truthful. But many things he say are both novel and true, and so the book is very much worth reading.
