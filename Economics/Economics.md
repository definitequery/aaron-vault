The study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. How do we produce things? Who decides what to produce?
Once we've created things, how do we decide who gets them? How do people consume things? Why do they consume them? How do they decide which things to consume?

An alternative definition by Lionel Robbins:  
"Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."

## History  
Since ancient history, writers and philosophers have thought about the optimal way to produce goods and services.

Mercantilists:
- An economic doctrine claiming that the wealth of a nation depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without natural access to gold and silver could acquire it in two ways:
  - Sell goods abroad
  - Restrict imports other than gold and silver
  Mercantilism called for importing inexpensive raw materials for manufacturing goods to be exported. Protective state regulation on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit colonial manufacturing.

One implication of mercantilism is high domestic prices for imported goods and services due to tariffs and protectionist policies. Another implication is broader inefficiency, as mercantilist policies mean lack of specialization. Nations cannot exploit their competitive advantages in a mercantilist system. The core idea of mercantilism is kind of ridiculous; a nation's wealth certainly depends on other things than just its store of gold and silver (currency). Other forms of material wealth like food, culture, and technology are valuable.

Mercantilism is very autarkic in its thinking. Against integration with other nations and parties. Highly nationalist. Likely reason for its popularity in modern isolationist right-wing movements.

Physiocrats:
- Claimed that the economy was a circular flow of income and output. Only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost. Therefore, agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Opposed mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture. Replace costly tax collections with a single tax on the income of landowners (GEORGISM). More laissez-faire economic policy in contrast to mercantilist government intervention.

Physiocratic beliefs are broadly more correct than mercantilism. Advocated less government intervention in market operations. Georgism I'm not sure about. Perhaps the biggest flaw of physiocracy is its excessive focus on agriculture. Agricultural production is the not only form of production that generates a clear surplus. Manufacturing is valuable to industrial economies. Better model of the economy as a circular flow. Better focus on material wealth and productive capacity.
