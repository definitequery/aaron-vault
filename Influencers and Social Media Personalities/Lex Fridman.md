Today, I unsubscribed from Lex Fridman's YouTube channel. I've been upset with Lex's coverage of political topics for a long time.

Lex Fridman professes to build his content on love, compassion, and finding truth and prosperity through "the power of conversation". He claims to be a political "centrist". None of these ideas are wrong on their own. Indeed, conversation and compromise are the roots of a
functioning democracy, and centrism or moderate political views are perfectly justifiable.

However, these views in the wrong contexts can be toxic, uninteresting, bad faith, or give cover to bad actors and their behavior. In recent months, I'm sad to say that Lex's content has drifted into this zone for me.

Let's start with the love and positivity angle. Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with a brand built on love and positivity. In a world full of challenges and negative algorithmic stimulation, a healthy dose of happiness resets the conversation to a more productive zone. However, Lex buys into this to such a degree that he seems to treat conflict and harsh criticism as antithetical and something to avoid. This shows in the tone and manner of his podcast, being frankly one of safe and unchallenging interviews except in the most obvious of cases like Kanye West. Love and positivity have their place in political discourse, as do passion, anger, criticism, and blunt truths delivered to those who deserve it. Lex's inability to do this makes his podcast, at best, not very valuable to me and, at worst, infuriating.

Regarding Lex's centrism, I believe Lex occupies an infamous space in online political discourse known as the Enlightened Centrist. This form of centrism is not like standard moderate political beliefs. A true moderate holds beliefs that are a mixture of both ideological sides. In fact, on individual issues, a moderate can hold views that are strongly in favor of one side or the other depending on the issue at hand. For example, a moderate on the issue of climate
change is likely to believe that human-caused climate change is a real phenomenon and a threat to human prosperity, while denying the apocalyptic hysterics and radical eco-activism of groups like Extinction Rebellion. On its face, this view sounds quite reasonable. However, grafting it onto the American political dichotomy puts one squarely in the camp of moderate Democrats.

Enlightened Centrism is a form of faux centrism. In the worst cases, it's actually ideological favoritism masquerading as non-partisanship under the veneer of "centrism". In this way, members of a rank-and-file ideology can paint their beliefs as reasonable, seeking validation and affirmation of their belief system while acting like they're just innocent truth-seekers and not ideological conformists. Furthermore, the purveyors of this content can shield themselves from criticism of being partisan, wielding their label as a shield while their behavior indicates anything but. In less serious cases, Enlightened Centrism expresses itself as inability to take a strong position on one side or the other of a serious issue. Importantly, this occurs even in the presence of strong evidence that would significantly push a true rational actor towards one side or the other. In this way, it gives credence to those on the wrong side of contentious topics,
lending them credibility and favor that they otherwise do not deserve.

Combining these together creates a recipe for a Lex Fridman that is unable to engage in challenging conversations while displaying a faux centrism that allows bad faith and malicious actors to broadcast to wide audiences while encountering little pushback, laundering their reputations while increasing Lex's own clout in the process. I believe Lex Fridman is guilty of *both* forms of Enlightened Centrism laid out above. Below I've provided examples of Lex's behavior that I think justify this belief.

In this interview with political streamer Destiny, Lex Fridman criticizes Joe Biden for making a comment about MAGA Republicans during a speech at Independence
Hall in Pennsylvania. Lex's belief seems to be that Biden has engaged in unfair and divisive rhetoric against Republicans. Importantly, whether he knows it or not,
*Lex is repeating an argument put forward by defenders of Donald Trump and the right-wing*. They proceed to watch a clip of Biden's speech where he clearly makes a
distinction between MAGA Republicans that are beyond reason and a threat to the country and mainstream Republicans that are valuable and that he has worked with.

Lex says that "even extending to that line is not bringing people together", and that Joe Biden has unfairly criticized 80 million voters for Donald Trump.

Contrast the above instance of Joe Biden clearly making a distinction between MAGA Republicans and mainstream Republicans with this clip of Lex interviewing
a historian about January 6th. To be frank, this is one of the most infuriating Lex Fridman clips I've ever listened to. Combined with the above example and
the evidence of what we know occurred on January 6th, 2021, I believe it paints the most convincing picture of how Enlightened Centrism weakens those who do good
while simultaneously empowering the destructive. Most outrageously, Lex seems to doubt that Donald Trump would've taken advantage of the chaos of Mike Pence being
kidnapped or killed to stay in power. Bare in mind, this is the same Donald Trump who, at this point, *had called the entire election fraudulent, created
and transmitted fake electoral votes, and asked his Vice President to disenfranchise the vote of millions*.

Lex Fridman's interview with Donald Trump is entirely unchallenging, safe, and delivers no meaningful challenge to a presidential candidate. Ask yourself - if Joe Biden
had taken this interview, would the outcome be the same? Lex never once bothers to follow up on a question or demand a more concise or acceptable answer.

All of this taken together means that Lex's podcast is not worth my time to listen to.
At best, even when he interviews famous mathematicians or computer scientists, he asks surface-level questions that are uninteresting and that I can learn from my own.
At worst, when I'm familiar with the individual he's speaking with and know they're malicious, it will just infuriate me and make me upset.
