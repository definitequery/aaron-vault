#### **Step 0: Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals**
Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals. Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical. Housing costs, utilities, and basic sustenance are harder to eliminate than "entertainment," eating out, or clothing expenses.
Once your budget is figured out, figure out what your goals are. Secure retirement? Buy a house? Save for a car?
#### **Step 1: Build an emergency fund**
An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up i.e. unexpected travel, essential appliance replacement, sudden medical procedures, etc. If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it.

**Size**:
For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund (e.g., 9 to 12 months) may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain.

Generally emergency funds should be held in safe investments you can liquidate in a hurry. FDIC-insured savings or checking accounts are the most common choice. CDs and I bonds can be used, but I bonds are only suitable for emergency savings after the initial 12-month lock-up period. You may also need to pay an early withdrawal penalty for some CDs and if you redeem an I bond before it is five years old, you lose the last three months of interest. Things that should never be used include stocks, credit cards, HELOCs, or anything that is volatile in value or that can be taken away without warning (such as lines of credit).
#### **Step 2: Employer-sponsored matching funds**
Ensure you are contributing enough to your employer-sponsored retirement plan (if available) to get any matching funds from your employer (if they offer them). The reason you do this before paying off high interest debt is that employer matching funds are risk-free, guaranteed returns on your investments at (usually) a higher rate than your debts. This step applies to any employer-sponsored account where the employer contributes money or matches contributions (in addition to some 401(k) plans, this step applies to all SIMPLE IRAs, some 403(b) plans, some 457 plans, and some Thrift Savings Plans).
#### **Step 3: Pay down high interest debts**
Pay down your high interest debt (e.g., debts much over 4% interest rate). In all cases, you should make the minimum payments on all of your debts before paying down specific debts more quickly.

**Two Methods**:
- **Avalanche Method:** Debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate. This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method.
- **Snowball Method:** Debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest. Paying off small debts first may give you a psychological boost and improve one's cash flow situation, as paid off debts free up minimum payments. The downside is that larger loans (that may be at higher interest rates) are left untouched for longer, costing more in the long run.
#### **Step 4: Contribute to an IRA**
Contribute to an IRA for the current tax year. You can also contribute for the previous tax year if it's between January 1st and April 15th. See the IRA wiki for more information on IRAs. Try to save up to 15% of your gross income until reaching the annual limit of $6,500.

IRAs generally have better fund choices than employer-sponsored plans because you can open one with the provider of your choice. Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds.

#### **Step 5: Save more for retirement**
After you've funded an IRA, if you still have money you want to put away for retirement then you should go back and round out your contributions to your employer-sponsored account (if available) so you are contributing as much as your budget allows. For specifics on 401(k) plans, see the wiki on 401(k) plans. As in step 2, you can't make direct contributions to your 401(k) (they have to come from payroll deductions). Adjust your contributions from your paycheck accordingly.
#### **Step 6: Save for other goals**
Once on track for retirement, there is more flexibility for discretionary income. The basic options are:
- Use tax-advantaged savings for anticipated future medical and education costs.
  - If you have an eligible high-deductible health plan (HDHP) and qualify, a health savings account (HSA) is a great way to save for future medical costs.
  - If you wish to save for college for your kids, yourself, or other relatives, consider a 529 fund in your state.
- Save for more immediate goals i.e. down payments for homes, vehicles, paying down low interest loans ahead of schedule, and vacation funds.
- Save more to retire early, only using taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options.
- Charitable giving
