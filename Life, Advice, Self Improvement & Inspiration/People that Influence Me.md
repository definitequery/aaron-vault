Salman Rushdie is an Indian-born British novelist. He's written both fiction and nonfiction. His most famous work is a fictional novel titled *The Satanic Verses*.

He proceeded to spend the next several years of his life in hiding, protected by Scotland Yard. In 2022, appearing on stage for an event in New York, Rushdie was stabbed and almost died. He wrote a memoir about the experience titled *Knife*, published in 2024.

Rushdie inspires me for a few reasons. Firstly, he's incredibly intelligent and well-cultured. His Indian heritage and residence in Britain and America give him a vast cultural language he can draw from, pulling in aspects of Eastern and Western culture. Second, Rushdie writes about political and cultural issues. Third, Rushdie is a successful fiction writer, winning the Booker Prize and being ranked by *The Times* as one of the best British writers since 1945. He's also been on the Time Magazine 100 Most Influential List and is commonly cited as a potential Nobel Prize in Literature winner. Fourth, his actions and perseverance after the publication of *The Satanic Verses* demonstrate immense courage.
