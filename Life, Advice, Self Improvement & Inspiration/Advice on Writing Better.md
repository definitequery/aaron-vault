**Reddit Comment:**
1. Read up on your first topic by using Google, e.g. "How to write better dialogue" and open up the first page of hits. _(This is your assigned reading)._
2. [This podcast](http://www.writingexcuses.com/) has a new topic each week, and they also provide a writing prompt at the end of each episode. Search for a podcast related to your topic, e.g. ["Dialogue"](http://www.writingexcuses.com/tag/dialog/). _(This is your recorded lecture)._
3. Do a writing prompt every day. Googling "writing exercises" will give you plenty of options, [like this one](http://writingexercises.co.uk/index.php), but also the podcast I mentioned gives a prompt every episode. Set aside at least 20 minutes a day to write. Let your ideas flow, and don't try so hard to get it right the first time. You have to write like crap, it's part of the process. _(This is your daily homework)._
4. Put one of your writing prompts, either your favorite or your least favorite, up for critique on this subreddit, at the weekly critique thread. Explain what topic you are doing. _(This is how you get feedback)._
5. Read books and pay close attention to how the author writes the aspect of writing that you are focusing on. The podcast also gives a topic-related recommendation. Take an excerpt you like and actually re-write it verbatim. This will give you a better idea why the author chose to write it that way. _(This is the reading for the upcoming essay)._
6. Write a two-page essay, double spaced, explaining why the excerpt is a good example of dialogue, or whatever your topic is. Analyze its strengths and weaknesses and give examples for both. _(This is the assigned essay)._
7. Take your critiqued writing prompt and rewrite it. _(For extra credit. You are such an overachiever)._
8. Then, move on to another topic. It's best if you pick the things you are worst at. By doing it this way, it's not unrealistic to expect that your weaknesses will become your strengths.

**C.S. Lewis Advice for Writing:**
1. Turn off the radio (internet & social media)
2. Read all the good books you can, and avoid nearly all magazines.
3. Always write (and read) with the ear, not the eye. You should hear every sentence you write as if it was being read aloud or spoken. If it does not sound nice, try again.
4. Write about what really interests you, whether it is real things or imaginary things, and nothing else. (Notice this means that if you are interested only in writing you will never be a writer, because you will have nothing to write about . . .)
5. Take great pains to be clear. Remember that though you start by knowing what you mean, the reader doesn’t, and a single ill-chosen word may lead him to a total misunderstanding. In a story it is terribly easy just to forget that you have not told the reader something that he needs to know—the whole picture is so clear in your own mind that you forget that it isn’t the same in his.’
6. When you give up a bit of work don’t (unless it is hopelessly bad) throw it away. Put it in a drawer. It may come in useful later. Much of my best work, or what I think my best, is the re-writing of things begun and abandoned years earlier.
7. Don’t use a typewriter. The noise will destroy your sense of rhythm, which still needs years of training.
8. Be sure you know the meaning (or meanings) of every word you use.
