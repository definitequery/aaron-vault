One of the largest gulfs between me and the rest of my generation is their visceral hatred of billionaires as inherently evil people. Should the founder of a company that creates a pandemic-ending vaccine, or the smartphone, or an operating system used on 70% of desktop computers not be a billionaire? Why not? Those things seem like meaningful contributions to humanity that have generated billions (trillions?) of dollars in value and human well being. I think you’d be hard-pressed to argue that those people shouldn’t make some amount of wealth for their contribution.

Obviously there are workers that helped them get there, and many entrepreneurs have a relatively privileged upbringing. No man is an island. Bill Gates didn’t invent Microsoft Windows himself. But that’s true of any human endeavour. I’ve noticed a tendency of these same people to fetishize “real labor” (whatever they arbitrarily deem that to be). They think administrative work like higher executives and management are “fake” jobs that don’t need to exist or provide no value. Not to attack anyone personally, but I’d be curious how many of these critics actually work those “real labor” jobs versus cushy white-collar administrative careers. As Orwell noted, the socialist is often a petty bourgeois himself rather than a member of the working class he claims to speak for.

I’m not saying billionaires are perfect gods that should be worshipped. I’m not a market fundamentalist. Markets are just policy tools that are appropriate for some things and inappropriate for others. There are many cases of companies that have abused their power and influence, but so have governments, unions, and activist groups. Something isn’t pure because it’s government-run and impure because it’s run for profit. Those are just means to an end.

There are valid questions about making sure the spoils of that wealth get distributed to the most people, but I don’t think any realistic solutions to that require “abolishing billionaires”. That’s simplistic thinking done for tribal signaling rather than legitimate problem-solving.
