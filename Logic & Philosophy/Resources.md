**Autodidactic Reddit Comment**  
(1) Listen to [Philosophy Bites](http://www.philosophybites.com/) weekly.

(2) Start to read some of the historical "Greats" of philosophy in a chronological order. But try to make it manageable. To do this, I would get a _History of Philosophy_ textbook with readings from the Greats. Also, listen to LMU's and KCL's really awesome [history of philosophy without any gaps](http://historyofphilosophy.net/)
(3) Pick up a book in Logic and Critical Thinking, and learn First Order Predicate Logic. You can do this by taking a Logic course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). You can else look at the free [Teach Yourself Logic](http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/TeachYourselfLogic2016.pdf). Later, apply logic to the philosophical arguments you will learn about.

(4) Learn philosophical arguments. To do this, work through an Introduction to Philosophy textbook first. For example, this is a good one:
_Introduction to Philosophy_
- Cahn, M. "Exploring Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology" 5th Edition, Oxford University Press.

Next, do it piecemeal for the main subjects. I recommend the following textbooks, but you can find other ones that might be more suitable to you and your learning style:
- Shafer-Landau, R. "The Fundamentals of Ethics", 3rd Edition, Oxford University Press.
- Fisher,A. "Metaethics: An Introduction", Routledge.
_Metaphysics_
- Connee, E., and Ted Sider. "Riddles of Existence: A Guided Tour of Metaphysics", Oxford University Press.
_Epistemology and Mind_
- Pritchard, D. "What is this thing called Knowledge?" 3rd Edition, Routledge.
- Kim, J. "Philosophy of Mind", 3rd Edition, Westview Press.
_Logic & Language_
- Lycan, W. "Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction", 2nd edition, Routledge.
When you want to either (a) get stuck or (b) wish move onto another area or something more specific, use the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/) or the [Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://www.iep.utm.edu/) as resource guide. From there, make a bibliographic list of papers to read on the topic you're interested in, based on the SEP or IEP entries. Later, look for those papers on Philpapers.org or use Google.

(5) Take online courses in Philosophy. Coursera has a pretty good regular list. I recommend:
- [Introduction to Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy) from the University of Edinburgh on Coursera.

(6) Attend philosophical meetings and/or become a member of a philosophical society that has regular meetings. This allows you to see the state-of-the-art of professional philosophy, talk with other philosophers, etc. Depending on where you live and your financial situation, this might be easy or difficult. For example, in Britain, we have:
- [The Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/)
- [The Mind Association](http://www.mindassociation.org/)
- [The Royal Institute of Philosophy](http://royalinstitutephilosophy.org/)
Also, every year there is a nice conference called the [Joint Session of the Mind and Aristotelian Society](https://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/the-joint-session/).

If you're in the states, there is the [American Philosophical Association](http://www.apaonline.org/) and their [various sub-associations](http://www.apaonline.org/general/recommended_links.asp) that are represented during their annual conferences or on their own. Also, check out the nearest philosophy faculty website about what events they have going on. In general, you can use [PhilEvents](http://philevents.org/) to find out where/when a philosophy event is happening.

(7) Keep up to date on the areas you are interested in via [PhilPapers](http://philpapers.org/). You can often get free papers through PhilPapers, ask questions on the message board, and stay up to date on the trends in professional philosophy.

(8) Make use of online lectures and discussions via: [wiphi](http://www.wi-phi.com/), [Philosophy TV](http://www.philostv.com/), [Oxford Faculty of Philosophy Podcasts](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/podcasts), [Open Culture: Philosophy](http://www.openculture.com/philosophy_free_courses), [r/askphilosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy), or search Youtube for Philosophy lectures.

(9) Start a local reading group or form a Philosophy Cafe (through something like meetup.com). [Here's](http://www.meetup.com/Philosophy-Cafe-Cafe-Philosophique/) an example of the one from Berkeley, Ca.

(10) Follow the [London Philosophy Study Guide](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/LPSG/contents.htm). What is this? It's the 'papers' for getting a degree in Philosophy with a specialisation in some area therein. These are the core readings for the subject areas. Finish a paper, and you have read what is expected of one who gets the degree in that subject area. In the older language, one "reads for their degree". For example, here's the [Epistemology Paper](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/LPSG/Ep&Meth.htm).
