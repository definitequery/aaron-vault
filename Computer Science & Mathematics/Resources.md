**List of Needed Skills**
- **Pre-Algebra** (including taking powers, prime factorization, divisibility tests, and understanding the use of variables; used loosely here to cover elementary-level mathematics too, but there usually is a middle-school class called "pre-algebra")
- **Basic Algebra** (including solving linear and quadratic equations, identifying properties of lines and vertical parabolas from their equations, determining average rates of change and estimated accumulation, factorization and expansion of polynomials, operations on exponents and roots, systems of equations in multiple variables, and operations on 2×2 and 3×3 matrices; requires pre-algebra)
- **Plane Geometry** (mostly to motivate integrals and trigonometric functions; requires some basic algebra and is often taken between the first and last parts of such a class)
- **Pre-Calculus**, which includes
    - *Elementary Functions* (including exponentials and logarithms, and how to change a function so that its graph is shifted around, or stretched horizontally or vertically; requires basic algebra)
    - *Trigonometry* (the trig functions show up all over the place, and you need to be comfortable with the relationships among them; requires basic algebra and plane geometry)
    - *Analytic Geometry* (the conic sections, and rotation of coordinate axes, show up quite often in applied mathematics; requires basic algebra and plane geometry)
- **Linear Algebra** (working in a structured manner with vectors, basically lists of numbers, and linear transformations on vector spaces; requires basic algebra, although plane geometry is good for developing intuition)
- **Single-Variable Calculus** (finding limiting values of expressions, using the limit concept to turn average rates of change and estimated accumulation into instantaneous rates of change and actual accumulation, a.k.a. derivatives and integrals, learning the information derivatives tell about functions, numerous techniques of integration, convergence of sequences and series, and techniques to numerically approximate integrals that cannot be found in closed form; requires a pre-calculus class that covered the trigonometric and other elementary functions and their transformations)
- **Multi-Variable Calculus** (the derivative concept extended to vector-valued functions and functions of multiple variables, parameterization of curves and surfaces, line and surface integrals, possibly coverage of curvature and torsion of curves, and curvature of surfaces, something covered more fully in differential geometry; requires single-variable calculus and linear algebra, the latter of which is often covered in brief during such a class)
- **Ordinary Differential Equations** (numerous methods of exactly solving differential equations for functions of one variable, a.k.a. ordinary differential equations, methods of solving systems of ODEs, methods to numerically approximate solutions to initial- and boundary-value problems; requires single-variable calculus, and linear algebra for the later parts)
- **Partial Differential Equations** (solution methods for the few differential equations involving functions of more than one variable, a.k.a. partial differential equations, that can be solved exactly, and techniques to determine whether particular boundary-value problems have solutions and how those solutions behave; requires linear algebra, ODEs, and multi-variable calculus)
