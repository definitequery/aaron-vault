**Short Summary**
In this essay, George Orwell laments decline of the English language, diagnosing its degradation as one cause of the ongoing political chaos. He gives examples of bad English passages, establishes why they're bad, and gives recommendations and rules for how to improve, as well as justifications for those rules. He reiterates a consistent theme throughout of all his writing: the importance of language to politics. What you can achieve and argue for or against politically is constrained by what you can think, and what you can think is altered by the language you use. One of Orwell's arguments against unclear language is that it enables political conformity, serves insincerity, and helps euphemize the unjustifiable. Orwell advocates action against this degradation, pushing the reader to understand that this is not irresistible and that action can be taken.

**Shorter Summary**
In this essay, George Orwell laments the decline of the English language and its relevance to the degradation of politics. He argues that this decline is not natural or irreversible, but a choice and one that can be pushed back against. He gives examples of bad English and rules for how to improve.

**Reading Notes**
Many people think English is in trouble, but think we can't do anything about it. People think that any struggle against the abuse of language is like preferring candles to electric light, or horses to cars. Underneath this lies the assumption that language is a natural growth, and not a human invention that be shaped to our own ends. Bad thoughts can cause language to degenerate, but degenerating language can increase the occurrence of bad thoughts, further degenerating the language. However, with intentional effort, the process is reversible. This is important and has relevance to politics.
- A constant theme in Orwell's work is the power of language. This theme also appears in 1984. As O'Brien confesses at the end of the book, one of the goals of Ingsoc is to use Newspeak to reduce the capability of citizens to think revolutionary thoughts.
Orwell proceeds to list examples of bad English and patterns they exhibit:
- **Outdated metaphors**, or improper use of metaphors.
- **Operators or verbal false limbs**, using excessive words where on would suffice; the passive voice i.e. *render inoperative* instead of *break*.
- **Pretentious diction**: Complex words where simple ones would suffice. Give an air of impartiality to biased judgements. Make work sound "scientific." Using foreign words to give an air of culture or elegance.
- **Meaningless words**: Words that have no precise meaning e.g. *romantic*, *plastic*, *dead*, *natural*. Common in art criticism. Using words like this is dismissed as a mere difference of opinion, rather than actual contradiction. Political words get their meanings commonly reduced. *Fascism* doesn't have a meaning anymore except "something not desirable." When we call a country *democratic*, we are praising it. 
Orwell bemoans the fact that modern writing is not done for conveying meaning and inventing images, but rather piecing together dead, ready-made phrases that are easy to write, but don't hit as hard and simply fill pages. They obscure rather than clarify, reducing the ability of their author to think and their audience to understand.
According to Orwell, a scrupulous writer in every sentence will ask:
1. What am I trying to say?
2. What words will express it?
3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?
And further:
5. Could I put it the same way in less words?
6. Have I said anything avoidably ugly?
Importantly, and dangerously, you can easily forgo this work and carry on as usual. The ready-made phrases will come to you easily. They'll construct sentences and even entire thoughts for you. However, they will only serve to conceal and abstract rather than clarify and sharpen.
Orwell says that most political writing is bad writing, because it's intentionally made stale to put forth a party line. The clearest political writing using comes from outsiders and rebels. Orthodoxy, regardless of its origin or stripe, demands a lifeless, imitative style. This machine-like writing makes it possible to repeat things without actually thinking about their meaning, favoring political conformity.
Political speech and writing is largely defense of the indefensible. Its writers have to use euphemism, question-begging, and cloudy vagueness, because clarity would show that the things being defended are too brutal to excuse.

"The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink."
-- George Orwell

Orwellian example of bad writing:
"The Allies have an opportunity not only of achieving a radical transformation of Germany’s social and political structure in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself, but at the same time of laying the foundations of a co-operative and unified Europe."

Written better:
"The Allies have a chance to radically transform Germany's social and political structure in a way that avoids a nationalistic reaction and simultaneously unifies Europe."

**Additional rules:**
1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
