Pro-Ukraine
- Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a violation of international law and completely unjustified. It is not an isolated incident, but rather a frontal assault on the system of international rules and norms by the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin. Putin sees Ukraine as a fake country; a fiction put in place by a conspiracy of Western actors seeking to destroy Russia. By his own admission, he believes the collapse of the Soviet Union was a catastrophe. He wants to rebuild the Russian/Soviet Empire by threatening the sovereignty of Eastern Europe, starting with Ukraine. The broader West should stand with Ukraine, defend her land, and extract harsh concessions from Russia if peace is to be achieved. Weapons should be provided to destroy Russia's military capabilities. If Ukrainian land is to be ceded, it should come with strong security guarantees. The West should demand the return of some Ukrainian territories, and should not give up the prospect of Ukrainian NATO membership. Russia's invasion has zero rational basis in fact or morality. It is one of the most black and white issues currently in the world. Absolutely none of Russia's allegations support the invasion of a sovereign nation. Sadly, I have no hope that such an outcome will be achieved. The Trump administration is likely to abandon Ukraine. The Ukrainian front will probably collapse or harsh concessions will have to be made on terms unfavorable to the Ukrainian government.

Not much of the ancient history of Russia and Ukraine is relevant frankly. This entire conflict can be studied starting from 1991 onwards, when the Soviet Union collapsed and every country on Earth, including Russia, recognized it as a sovereign country.

- Points to research:
  - History of the conflict
  - Common pro-Russian talking points
    - 2014 "coup" of Viktor Yanukovych
    - Genocide of ethnic Russians
    - NATO expansion
    - Victoria Nuland phone call
    - War in Donbas
    - Invasion of Crimea
    - Neo-Nazis in Ukraine

Pro-Taiwan
- Taiwan's independence should be defended. At the very least, the Cross-Strait status quo should be maintained. Taiwan has a critical role to play in the semiconductor supply chain. Losing it to China is absolutely not an option from a national security standpoint. If the semiconductor supply chain was removed from the country, I think the case for defending it becomes a lot more difficult.

Anti-populism
- Why am I anti-populist?
  I'm against populism because populists have no care for political norms and institutions. Because of this, they tend to fail on two fronts:
  - Seeing problems where none exist: Populists tend to create conflict, conspiracy, and controversy around entirely uncontroversial things. This is usually the
  result of misinformation, pushed by alternative media with loose regard for truth. For example, in 2024 a hurricane hit the southeastern United States.
  Presidential candidate Donald Trump pushed a lie that people were given $750 to rebuild their entire lives and that $750 was the only assistance people were
  getting. This is not true. The program is called Serious Needs Assistance and is only the beginning of help that people are eligible for. Conspiracies like
  this discouraged people from getting the help they needed in the aftermath of a natural disaster. This entire controversy was manufactured out of nothing.
  - Lack of effective solutions when problems do exist: Even if populists can accurately identify a problem, because they don't understand how things work, the solutions they give are typically suboptimal or ineffective. These solutions are often chosen for aesthetic reasons or ideological purity rather than legitimate analysis of effectiveness. The ideology comes first and everything else second. 
  This doesn't mean that I think our political system and institutions are flawless. But you can't accurately identify problems or propose solutions until you understand how things work in the first place. You need to understand why the system currently works the way it does. You need to respect the wisdom of that came before you. You need to have humility and understand that the system currently in place was not put there by evil politicians or billionaires trying to kill you, but by honest people trying to solve a problem given constraints. Things are usually done a certain way for a very good reason and it behooves you to understand what that reason is before you go about changing things.

Anti-Trump
- I could write an entire paper on this topic. So much to come...

Opposition to excessive woke
- Cringe and stupid. Harmful to the identity of Democrats and the broader left.

Pragmatic
Softly pro-Israel
- Two-state solution
  - The only realistic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a two-state solution. Right now, Israelis and Palestinians cannot live in peace with one another. Palestinians must come to terms with the fact that they will not get back all of Israel.
- Right to a Palestinian state
  - The right of Jews to a state does not negate aspirations of the Palestinian people. They were the original inhabitants of the land of Israel and have the right to self-determination. Note, such a state must be conditional on peace and abiding by international law. Terrorism from such a state is unacceptable.
- Israel's right to exist and right to defend itself
  - Zionism is not a fascist movement or an ethnonationalist movement. It's the belief in the need for Jews to have a state of their own where they can feel safe and protected. I believe history shows why this is needed. In most nations where Jews have been a minority, especially Arab states, they have been subjected to pogroms.
- Opposition to Netanyahu and the Likud
  - Benjamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, is a corrupt and power-hungry snake of a politician. He has zero desire to solve the conflict and has no respect for the humanity of Palestinians or their right to self-determination. He has shown a willingness to coalition-build with the worst elements of Israeli politics to keep himself in power and deny the Palestinians what they deserve. His political party Likud is no better. The charter of Hamas is an anti-Semitic document that calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and the genocide of the Jews, but the charter of Likud is no better, calling for Zionist maximalism and the refusal of a Palestinian state anywhere in the former territory of Mandatory Palestine.
