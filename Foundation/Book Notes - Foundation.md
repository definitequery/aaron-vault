**I**
**Hari Seldon** is the kind of guy Jane Street would kill to hire: a mathematics professor at a prestigious university who develops a psycho-mathematical-statistical model that predicts the outcomes of human behavior in large groups. Not just boring basic principles like “people seek to maximize their own utility”, but detailed predictions about the rise and fall of civilizations; technological development and stagnation; and the ensuing high points or dark ages.

The only problem is that Hari Seldon hasn’t been born yet and probably never will be.

The story begins on the planet Trantor, gleaming capital of the expansive Galactic Empire. Gaal Dornick, a recent mathematics doctorate, is invited by Seldon to join his psychohistory research project. Very quickly, Gaal realizes something much deeper is going on. Seldon shows him his model predicting that the collapse of the Galactic Empire is imminent and unavoidable, with such a collapse bringing 30,000 years of darkness to the galaxy. Rather than waste time and resources trying to prevent the inevitable, Seldon believes he can reduce this period to 1,000 years. Deftly maneuvering around political consequences from the threat his research poses to the Imperial government, he gets himself exiled to the planet Terminus in the far-flung edges of the galaxy. There, with a team of the Empire’s brilliant minds, he starts the Foundation.

From here, the book jumps through different points in the Foundation’s history, starting early after Seldon has died with the Empire beginning to fracture politically, and moving later and later as different characters seek to guide the Foundation through changing circumstances and various threats to its existence, known as Seldon Crises. In doing so, they slowly fulfill the parameters of Seldon’s original model and form the seed of the Second Galactic Empire.

Asimov’s Foundation touches on themes like science, technology, diplomacy, religion, and the long arc of history. It’s a story of various individuals trying to build a lasting institution, not by following a rigid set of rules ordained by ancient ancestors, but by recognizing the realities of the times they live in and following the gradient of their incentives. Indeed, the predictive power of Seldon’s psychohistory relies on this assumption. Foundation oddly manages to be both a strong affirmation and rebuke of the Great Man Theory of History. Most importantly, it’s a meditation on the nature of power and the different ways societies can hold leverage over one another, or how the same society can wield different types of leverage at different stages in its history.

**II**
It's worth pausing to consider Foundation's choice of hero. Hari Seldon isn't a warrior, politician, or chosen one - he's a mathematics professor. His power comes not from physical prowess or divine right, but from his ability to understand and model complex systems. If this sounds like wish fulfillment for a certain type of person, well, that's exactly why Foundation resonates so deeply in Silicon Valley.

The book presents a world where scientific knowledge isn't just abstractly valuable - it's the key to real power. When Salvor Hardin faces down the military might of Anacreon, he doesn't win through force of arms, but through superior scientific understanding and technological leverage. The Foundation's power grows not through conquest but through creating technological dependencies in neighboring systems. Replace "nuclear power" with "cloud infrastructure" or "mobile operating systems," and you have a pretty good description of how modern tech companies build their empires.

This vision of scientific expertise as the ultimate source of power speaks directly to Silicon Valley's self-image. It suggests that the people best equipped to shape the future aren't politicians or businessmen, but those who deeply understand technology and systems. It's no accident that tech founders often frame themselves as engineer-philosophers rather than mere businesspeople.

**III**
The parallels between Foundation's Terminus and Silicon Valley are almost too perfect to be coincidental. Terminus sits at the edge of the galaxy, far from the decaying center of imperial power. Silicon Valley perches on the western edge of America, deliberately distant from Washington's bureaucratic inertia. Both begin as centers of scientific and technological knowledge - Terminus with its Encyclopedia Foundation, Silicon Valley with Stanford and Berkeley. Both transform into something far more powerful than mere academic outposts.

But the parallel goes deeper than geography. Like the Foundation, Silicon Valley sees itself not as a mere industrial center but as a civilization unto itself - the last beacon of progress in an otherwise stagnating world. When tech leaders talk about "acceleration" or "progressing humanity," they're echoing the Foundation's self-appointed role as guardians of civilization's future.

**IV**
Foundation's central premise - that progress is fragile and must be actively preserved - finds a modern echo in the work of Patrick Collison and Michael Nielsen on "progress studies." Their core argument, that scientific and technological progress isn't inevitable but requires specific cultural and institutional conditions, could have come straight from Hari Seldon's lectures.

The Foundation's mission isn't just to preserve knowledge, but to maintain the social and economic conditions that make progress possible. This mirrors contemporary concerns about scientific stagnation and technological slowdown. When Collison writes about the declining productivity of scientific research or the increasing difficulty of technological innovation, he's identifying exactly the kind of civilizational crisis that Seldon worried about.

**V**
The Encyclopedists' story in Foundation's opening chapters offers a particularly relevant warning about the relationship between scientific pursuit and political reality. The initial Foundation scientists, tasked with compiling the Encyclopedia Galactica, believe they can remain above the political fray, focusing purely on their scholarly mission. They dismiss Hardin's warnings about local political tensions as irrelevant to their grand scientific project. This mirrors a persistent tension in Silicon Valley: the desire to focus on pure technical problems while avoiding "messy" political realities.

But Foundation makes clear that this separation is impossible. The Encyclopedists' political naivety nearly leads to their destruction. Only when Hardin forces them to engage with political reality - to understand that scientific knowledge must be paired with political and social awareness - does the Foundation begin to truly fulfill its mission. The message is clear: technical expertise alone is insufficient. Progress requires not just scientific understanding but the ability to navigate complex social and political environments.

This plays out repeatedly through the Seldon Crises. While Seldon's psychohistory can predict broad historical forces, managing these crises requires individuals who understand both technical and political realities. Hardin succeeds not just because he's clever, but because he grasps that scientific knowledge must be translated into political and economic power to be effective. The same is true of Hober Mallow, who combines technical understanding with trade savvy and political cunning. These characters represent a particular kind of "great man" - not the pure scientist like the Encyclopedists, nor the pure politician like their opponents, but hybrid figures who can bridge both worlds.

This archetype profoundly influences Silicon Valley's own great man theory. The most celebrated founders are rarely pure technologists. Instead, the valley venerates figures who combine technical expertise with political and business acumen - think Steve Jobs pairing technical vision with marketing genius, or Marc Andreessen transitioning from inventor to kingmaker. Even Elon Musk's public image is carefully cultivated to present him as both engineering guru and political provocateur. Like Hardin and Mallow, these figures are celebrated not just for their technical innovations, but for their ability to transform technical possibility into real-world power.

This lesson remains relevant for Silicon Valley today. Tech companies and founders often begin with the Encyclopedists' mindset - a desire to focus purely on technical innovation while avoiding political entanglement. But like the Foundation, they inevitably discover that technological progress cannot be separated from political and social questions. Whether it's content moderation, AI safety, or privacy regulations, the industry increasingly faces challenges that cannot be solved through technical expertise alone.

**VI**
Maybe the most interesting thing about Foundation's inclusion in the Silicon Valley canon is what it reveals about tech culture's relationship with power. The Foundation begins as a scholarly project but inevitably becomes an imperial power in its own right. It shapes history not just through prediction but through active intervention.

This mirrors an evolution we've seen in Silicon Valley itself - from a culture of curious tinkerers to one wielding enormous social and economic power. Like the Foundation, Silicon Valley's power grew through phases: first through technical knowledge, then through control of crucial infrastructure, finally through economic dominance.

Yet there's a crucial difference. The Foundation was planted deliberately, with a clear mission spanning centuries. Silicon Valley emerged organically and remains deeply intertwined with the power structures it claims to be replacing. Its companies might see themselves as the Foundation, but they're as much part of the "Empire" as they are its successor.

This tension between Silicon Valley's self-image as civilization's savior and its reality as part of the existing power structure might be the most relevant parallel to Foundation in 2025. As artificial intelligence and other technologies give tech companies ever more power to shape society, they face the same questions the Foundation did: What responsibilities come with the power to shape history? How do you preserve progress without becoming the very thing you sought to replace? And perhaps most importantly, can the "nerdy power fantasy" of rational scientific governance survive contact with actual power?
