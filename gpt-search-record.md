The user wants a list of nuanced, rigorous thinkers in the fox-style framework, avoiding proselytism and intellectual dishonesty—those who embrace analytic uncertainty. I’m considering offering a list across diverse domains such as politics, economics, science, and forecasting. Some names could be Ethan Mollick, Holden Karnofsky, Gwern Branwen, Nate Silver (maybe controversial though?), Andrew Gelman, Ben Casselman. I’ll aim for a balanced, up-to-date collection that reflects open-minded, multi-domain evidence-based approaches in line with their request.

Here are some potential thinkers that match the "fox" style:

Tyler Cowen (idiosyncratic, but widely considered nuanced)

Scott Alexander (Astral Codex Ten)

Zvi Mowshowitz (LessWrong)

Luke Muehlhauser

Kelsey Piper (Vox Future Perfect)

Dylan Matthews

These individuals are known for their analytical approach, but they might have biases. I should mention each thinker’s strengths and offer strategies for exploring their work. I’ll consider including other up-to-date experts like Robert Wiblin based on current trends. Time to gather some fresh info!

I’m considering key thinkers like Tyler Cowen (idiosyncratic but nuanced), Scott Alexander (Astral Codex Ten), and Zvi Mowshowitz (LessWrong). Other sources could include Luke Muehlhauser, Kelsey Piper, and Dylan Matthews, though they may have some biases. Each thinker needs a quick explanation of why they qualify. I'll keep things up-to-date by browsing for fresh picks, maybe top forecasters or names like Robert Wiblin. But I don’t think current events are strictly needed for this list.

There’s a rule to check for up-to-date info, even though the list of thinkers might stay static. Names like Tetlock and Cowen are key, but I should do a quick search to find any new forecasters trending for 2024-2025. A quick browse shows references to Good Judgment but not much else. I’ll include sources like Good Judgment’s page and Farnam Street, but I’ll make sure to support claims with citations from respected sources.

I’ll gather sources to back up the list of thinkers. We can refer to pages like the Good Judgment Project for Philip Tetlock, but I won’t rely solely on memory. For Tyler Cowen, I’ll include references about his nuanced perspective, possibly from sources like David Brooks. We'll also mention Farnam Street's "Ten Commandments." For now, I'll focus on using reliable sources and keep the list focused by avoiding unnecessary references.

Here’s a list of thinkers that I’ll include with references:

Philip Tetlock & Good Judgment – Their work is widely cited, and I'll link to the Good Judgment Project.

Tyler Cowen (Marginal Revolution) – Known for balanced perspectives; I’ll look up reviews or endorsements to back this.

Andrew Gelman – A statistical expert with notable work in modeling, I’ll potentially provide blog links as examples.

I'll mention additional thinkers to further build on the list:

Michael Nielsen – A computational scientist, might also touch upon his perspectives in "whole earth computing."

David Roodman – Not sure yet if I'll include his work, but I’ll check to be thorough.

Venkatesh Rao – His work could be relevant, though I still need to evaluate his contributions.

I'm considering some forecasts and meta-science experts to include in a list:

Philip Tetlock and the Good Judgment Project are key.

Julia Galef focuses on Scout Mindset.

Andrew Gelman is another solid one.

Nate Silver, despite splitting from ABC, still adds insight with FiveThirtyEight and his Substack.

Scott Alexander also fits, though with some nuances.

Zeynep Tufekci, an evidence-based cross-disciplinary thinker from the NYT, is definitely one to think about too.

I'm refining the list of thinkers, along with some categories:

General Forecasting & Meta-Science includes:

Philip Tetlock & the Good Judgment Project.

Julia Galef (Scout Mindset).

Andrew Gelman (statistics).

Scott Alexander (Astral Codex Ten).

Zeynep Tufekci (NYT writer).

Also adding David Spiegelhalter for statistics and risk. I'm excluding Sam Bankman-Fried due to scandal and Paul Graham due to some biases.

Okay, Holden Karnofsky (Open Philanthropy) fits the category nicely.

I might want to include thinkers like Vaclav Smil, who focuses on complex energy systems, and Dani Rodrik, an economist known for his balanced views. Also, Max Roser, from Our World in Data, is a great resource. I'll need to search for "Our World in Data unbiased rigorous" to help identify their key data sources and to check that its visualizations remain sound and reliable. This could provide useful context for interpreting data in an unbiased way.

I’m considering thinkers like Vaclav Smil (complex energy systems), Dani Rodrik (economist), and Max Roser (Our World in Data). I’ll search for "Our World in Data unbiased rigorous" — it sounds reliable, though I'll note the disclaimers. Other sources to consider include The Economist Data team, though it might be too broad. Fact-checkers like Our World in Data are solid, but I should be cautious about including the Medline blog. Also, each person could have "entry point" reading suggestions. We could compile a list of about 20 names.

I’m thinking about categorizing thinkers under "Meta-distillation & Rationality." Some names I’m considering include:

Scott Alexander (wide-ranging analysis, Astral Codex Ten)

Andrew Gelman (statistical modeling)

David Spiegelhalter (risk & uncertainty)

Gwern Branwen (Gwern.net)

Nate Silver (Silver Bulletin for forecasting)

Max Roser (Our World in Data)

And maybe Zeynep Tufekci (sociology and tech), Tyler Cowen (economics), Vaclav Smil (energy systems), and Dani Rodrik (economist). Possible addition: Catherine Rampell?

I'm considering adding Dan Wang (tech & geopolitics analyst) and thinking about Noah Smith (Noahpinion), though he may be a bit biased — but still moderate. Derek Thompson (Atlantic) adds nuance, so I'll keep him in mind. For economics and policy, I've got Tyler Cowen, Dani Rodrik, and Emily Oster (focused on data-driven parenting & public health). I’m also thinking about Michael Pettis (China macro) and Adam Tooze (historian & macro with nuance). I'll aim for 20 names total and organize them further.

I'm thinking of adding Dan Wang (tech and geopolitics analyst). Noah Smith (Noahpinion) could be useful, though he might have some bias, but he's fairly moderate. Derek Thompson from The Atlantic offers nuanced insight, so he’s a strong contender. For the Economics & Policy section, I’ve already got Tyler Cowen, Dani Rodrik, Emily Oster (public health), Michael Pettis (China macro), and Adam Tooze (historian with nuance). I need to categorize further, aiming for around 20 names total. Next, it's time to draft a response with proper sources and analysis.

For each category, I’ll list 3-5 names, including sources so every individual gets a citation. I'll ensure there's at least one citation for each person, providing general evidence, like citing their blog or book page. Each entry will include the person’s name, domain expertise, why they meet the criteria, and a recommended first read. Citations will follow after each person’s description. I want to make sure I can reference everything correctly, especially for people like Philip Tetlock, Julia Galef, and Andrew Gelman. The sources should be ready to cite!

For each person in the list, I want to provide citations like their website, blog, or book. I'll set up Source references where each entry includes why the person fits the criteria, listing 3-5 names per category. I’ll ensure each entry gets a citation with a clear link or resource referenced. For example: Philip Tetlock (Good Judgment Project) or Julia Galef. For Scott Alexander, I’ll use “Astral Codex Ten Balanced analysis.” I’ll also explore tech experts like Ethan Mollick to help balance out the list here.

Ethan Mollick one useful thing blog nuanced ai education analysis
I'm planning to list experts in various fields, with each entry supported by citations like their website, blog, or book. For example, in Forecasting & Rationality, I’ll include names like Philip Tetlock and Scott Alexander, making sure each one has a citation. I'll also touch on Tech experts like Ethan Mollick, but I’m wondering if I really need to include him after all. Seems like I might not need to cover everything in tech if I stay focused on the key people.

For the list, I need to keep the number manageable, maybe around 15-20 names. I’ll include a mix of individuals and institutions. Good Judgment Open, Our World in Data, and Polymarket will be useful sources. The list will be divided into categories like Forecasting & Metacognition, Economics & Policy, and so on. I’ll include experts like Philip Tetlock, Julia Galef, and David Spiegelhalter, providing brief descriptions of their domains, recommended reads, and any relevant biases. I’m mindful of focusing more on individuals over organizations.

I'm looking to create a manageable list of 15-20 people and sources. Good Judgment Open is worth including as an external group, along with others like our World in Data and Financial Times. I'll organize everything into categories like Forecasting & Metacognition, Economics & Policy, Science, Data, and Risk, and Tech & Society. It’s important to mention that experts may have biases, but they still provide valuable insights. I'll emphasize individuals over organizations but will include blogs as sources.

I’m aiming to create a list of 18 entries, focusing on top forecasters, rationality experts, economists, and other influential thinkers. I'll include people like Philip Tetlock (known for forecasting), Julia Galef (rationality), Scott Alexander (blog), and many more across different fields such as data analysis, risk, and economics. I'll also incorporate platforms like Good Judgment Open and impactful blogs like Our World in Data. Additionally, I’ll mention experts from various domains, offering balanced perspectives.

I’m pulling together a list of 17-20 influential thinkers across fields like forecasting, rationality, economics, and data science. This list includes experts like Philip Tetlock (forecasting), Julia Galef (rationality), Andrew Gelman (statistics), and Tyler Cowen (economics). I need to make sure to give at least one citation for each, and mention platforms like Good Judgment Open or Our World in Data. I’ll also find reliable references for experts I haven’t got details for yet.

Let's make sure all citations are complete!

I’ve gathered sources for Tetlock, Good Judgment Open, Julia Galef, and others. Some, like Dani Rodrik, need a quick search. Max Roser and Holden Karnofsky are covered, and I’ll look up content for Vaclav Smil next. After that, I still need to find a source for Gwern Branwen, so I’ll search for that too. I’m making progress but also realizing I need to balance being thorough while keeping it all moving smoothly.
