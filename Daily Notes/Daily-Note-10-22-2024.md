I'm inspired by Ira Glass as an intelligent creative speaker and radio host. The idea of being an audio/radio voice like C.S. Lewis or the BBC radio hosts of the old days during World War II is inspiring. In the modern era of podcasts, writing and audio naturally go together.

How famous do I want to be? Do I want to be famous or do I want to be remembered? Do I want to be famous among the masses, or famous among a select few? Do I want to be famous around the world, or famous in literary circles, rationalist circles, policy circles, bloggers, Tyler Cowen, and Scott Alexander types.
## Why Do I Write?
Thoughts on Meaning and Writing by Matt Lakeman
https://mattlakeman.org/2020/10/06/thoughts-on-meaning-and-writing/
- "As you can tell from this blog, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about great people. Napoleon, Cortes, Genghis Khan, Mark Schilling, Hideo Kojima, and Tommy Wiseau are not all good people, but they are great. Each one could easily earn a bullet point list like Bannon’s and Schwarzenegger’s. They’ve all built lives full of notable activities and accomplishments which will live on in history in one way or another."
- I want to live a noteworthy life on my own terms. I want my life to resemble a bullet point list like the lives of these people.
- I want to be able to sit at a computer and type out the actions, events, and people that I remember and be proud of the list before me.
- I try to do things that I'll *remember*. It's easy to fall into a cycle of routines and doing the same thing every day, fulfilling obligations before you and filling the rest of time with empty entertainment.
It's easy to watch your life slip away like this. It's important to find meaning every day. Watching a new movie and seeking new experiences is one way of fighting this. Contributing to lifelong projects like a Letterboxd or IMDB account is another. Writing is yet another way. *Writing is a cheap, easy way to remember & find meaning in every day.*
- Writing about things you read helps you remember them easier. It's one thing to read a book. It's another thing to read a book and then write an essay summarizing what you've read.

Why I Write by George Orwell
https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/
- Orwell thinks there are four great motives for writing.
  - Sheer egoism. The desire to seem clever, be talked out, be remembered after death, etc.
  - Aesthetic enthusiasm. A love for the aesthetic of language and literature. The pleasure of the beauty of the external world.
  The desire to share an experience one feels is valuable.
  - Historical impulse. To see things as they are. To find out true facts and store them up for use of posterity.
  - Political purpose. "Political" in the widest possible sense. To push the world in a certain direction. To alter ideas of the
  world we should strive after. No book is free of political bias. The idea that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself
  a political attitude.

Isaac Asimov wrote simply because he couldn't not write.
