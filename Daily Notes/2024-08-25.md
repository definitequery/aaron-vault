Every person has different "feeds". Some of those feeds are positive, some are negative. Ross Douthat has multiple "feeds",
namely Twitter and the New York Times. Matthew Yglesias' feeds are his Twitter and his Substack. Destiny's feeds are his Twitter,
his YouTube, his livestream, and now his podcasts. Even Elon Musk has feeds. His are Tesla, SpaceX, and his virulent Twitter. It's
okay to tune out one feed and tune into another. Only expose yourself to the best of a certain mind.
