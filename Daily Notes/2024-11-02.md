Dear Diary,

Today I woke up with a really dry mouth. I didn't sleep well last night. Thankfully, me and Deanna were able to sleep in. After spending the morning in bed on the Internet, I got up and made Deanna breakfast. I read the first few pages of the Pragmatic Programmer, then we went out to vote early. I voted for Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and Democrats all down the ballot. Deanna voted the same. After that, we went to the mall, ate food, and shopped for a few hours. Then we got back home. Deanna is doing laundry and I took some reading notes while listening to Sam Harris and Mark Cuban.

During their conversation, Sam and Mark talked about immigration and Kamala Harris' response to it. Immigration is an important issue is this presidential election. I'm depressed at how the Republican Party has chosen to respond to the issue of immigration. Under Donald Trump, the right-wing has come to see immigrants as leeches that come to America to commit crimes, steal jobs, and loot our public welfare system. That's not how Republicans have always felt. Ronald Reagan, when asked about the children of illegal immigrants in public schools, said to give the work permits and let them pay taxes. I'm reminded of an article linked by Byrne Hobart in one of his Longreads about a young woman from Guatamala that came to America and stole identities to create Uber/DoorDash accounts she could sell other illegal immigrants so they could make a living. Despite having information like driver's licenses and Social Security Numbers, she didn't make fake credit cards or bank accounts. She made *gig worker accounts* so people could earn income. The fact that people are willing to cross deserts and oceans, run from cartels, and climb border fences to come here is not a poison to the blood of our country; it's one of the best compliments you could ever give our country.
