Dear Diary,

Donald Trump won the election last night. Handily. He might even win the popular vote, which is just insane. I don't have much to say about this that I haven't said already. This morning I unfollowed all of my political feeds. It already is starting to feel like the days before I cared about politics. I'm done. Who knows what Donald Trump will do in power? Honestly, who cares. I just don't care anymore about any of it. Let him do what he wants and we can just resist as hard as we can if it goes too far. Worst-case-scenario, me and Deanna are wealthy enough that we can bug out. Maybe South Korea or Canada. We'll see if it comes to that. I'm just sad and angry.

Back to the other stuff. Here's how I'm spending my time moving forward.
- Playing and hopefully creating some video games.
- Self-studying math, engineering, & computer science.
- Reading Wikipedia.
- Exploring new music.
- Catching up on TV. Maybe I'll watch Formula 1 again.
- Taking care of the fundamentals of life.
- Spending time with Deanna. Planning a proposal and wedding.
- Writing more.
