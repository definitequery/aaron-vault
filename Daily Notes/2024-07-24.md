**Why do I think Kamala Harris can win this presidential election?**  
In 2023, everyone thought Ron DeSantis was the future of the Republican Party (?). There were numerous articles and thinkpieces written about how he was a "more effective
Donald Trump". Many on the left warned that the true danger was not Trump himself, but the more competent right-wing figure that came after him, inheriting his cult-like grasp on
American conservatism. Ron DeSantis looked to be this "Second Trump".

And then he wasn't.

I was never fully convinced by this initial thesis. It's easy to say that now with hindsight being 20/20, but I knew that supporters of Donald Trump didn't support him because of his
legislative accomplishments. Donald Trump didn't really do all that much for the people that voted for him. In fact, there's an argument that he actually made them *worse off* (?).
Donald Trump's base is fundamentally reactionary. It's less a cohesive coalition of individuals with a specific policy agenda, and more a loose collective of people that broadly hate the
mainstream media, establishment Republicans, establishment Democrats, the government, and whoever they deem as "the Left". The policy they support is any policy that succeeds at "triggering the
libs". Donald Trump saying "covfefe" is not a scandal you see, because the real story is how *obsessed* and *biased* and *horrible* the Fake News Mainstream Media were to print stories about it.
Note, this form of argument is roughly equivalent to smearing feces on yourself and then calling everyone who draws attention to that fact obsessed and biased. Now take that and make said
feces-covered individual the President of the United States, the functional mascot of our country, and you see why this story justifies headlines.

Regardless, Ron DeSantis was on top of the world and supposed to give Donald Trump a run for his money, forcing Trump to debate him and fight all the way to the Republican National Convention
where they would battle over precious delegates for the right to be the party's nominee. We were going to see a challenge similar to Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016, or Bernie
Sanders and Joe Biden in 2020. Here's how the primaries [actually played out](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/republican-primary/2024/national):

One of the reasons I have faith in Kamala Harris' ability to compete with Donald Trump, despite weak potential candidacy polls, is that we have an existence proof of potential candidacy polls being
less-than-reliable. If Ron DeSantis can go from the Future of the Republican Party to a pudding-finger laughing stock, Kamala Harris can go from "the weird cackling VP who told illegal immigrants
not to come", to "powerful candidate and real force for the 2024 Presidential election".

The Democratic Party's base has coalesced around Harris with shocking speed in the 48 hours since Joe Biden dropped out. With his bow, Joe Biden has taken with him some of the strongest Republican
attacks on the campaign, namely his age and Hunter Biden's criminal convictions. Republicans effectively have to start over from square one with less than 4 months until the election. Worse still,
though Biden has left the race, the smoke from arguments over his age and ability to serve, mostly from Republicans, could stick around and find its way to Trump himself. Trump will be 82 at the end
of his term if elected in November, not much less than the oft-quoted 86 years-old Biden would be were he still the nominee. Expect the focus to now shift towards Trump to justify why he is not guilty
of the same sins his former opponent was.

Furthermore, Donald Trump is not an unfamiliar face to Americans. At this point, the vast majority of the population are decided one way or another on how they feel about him. That impression
is unlikely to change this late in the game. Kamala Harris has no such limit. While that can potentially go *very* badly for the Democratic Party with the wrong surprise or scandal, it also presents
a daring threat to Trump if Kamala catches fire. His upside is limited, while hers can go much higher.
