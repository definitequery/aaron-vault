**Artificial Intelligence Summary**:  
The Green Revolution, spearheaded by Norman Borlaug, dramatically increased wheat yields in Mexico and elsewhere through the development of high-yielding, rust-resistant
dwarf wheat. However, Borlaug himself cautioned that this was a temporary solution to hunger, a prediction proven prescient by today's population growth.

Current projections suggest a significant shortfall in food production by mid-century, necessitating a second Green Revolution. Two recent books, Grunwald's We Are Eating
the Earth and Smil's How to Feed the World, explore potential solutions, but with differing levels of optimism.

Grunwald examines various approaches, including regenerative agriculture, vertical farming, and plant-based meat alternatives. However, he finds many of these solutions to be
overhyped and ultimately unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges of balancing food production with climate concerns.

Smil, conversely, emphasizes the importance of realistic solutions, focusing on reducing food waste and shifting dietary habits, particularly reducing meat consumption. He argues
that incremental improvements in existing agricultural practices, rather than technological breakthroughs, are more likely to yield significant results.

The legacy of the Green Revolution is complex. While it significantly increased food production, it also led to environmental problems like groundwater depletion and soil
contamination, disproportionately impacting poorer farmers. The need for a second Green Revolution is clear, but the path forward requires careful consideration of both its
potential benefits and its potential harms.

**My Thoughts**:  
- Very interesting article. Kind of depressing in some ways. A lot of interesting topics I'd like to read about more:
  - Genetics and biology of wheat
  - Science of agriculture
    - Chemistry of pesticides
    - Nitrogen depletion
    - Green Revolution
  - Current state of research on plant-based and lab-grown meat products
  - Political viability of reducing meat consumption
  - Vaclav Smil books seem really interesting scientifically
    - He criticizes lab-grown meat and bioreactor scale needed to met demand. What is the bottleneck here? Could this be made
    more efficient?
  - Climate politics
