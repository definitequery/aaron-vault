Dear Diary,

Today is Saturday. More time off work, but also more time to try and fill. Without politics, it's hard to find things to pass the time. The days are much longer. Considering my fear of death, it's strange that I'm apparently upset about this. I should spend more time just sitting around and thinking. I always tell Deanna to do that; maybe I should take my own advice. Overall though, I'm adjusting much nicer than expected. I've gotten back into video games. I started a new Melvor Idle playthrough. The wiki has given some useful guidance. The hard part of games like this is impatience. I've become much more impatient that realized.

This morning I was reading about worldbuilding and it sounds like a fun hobby. In a way, it's kind of what I always wanted to do. Even as a child, I was coming up with stories and universes. They were never any good, but I was coming up with them nonetheless. I feel like worldbuilding could put my reading to good use. Learning more about science, history, government, religion, etc. helps make my fictional universes more realistic. Minecraft fits in nicely here; writing a story about a city and then building it in Minecraft as a 3D realization helps make the universe more real. Worldbuilding will also make me write more. I could also create audio entries and share everything on YouTube and Substack. The important part is to stay focused on creativity for its own sake, rather than trying to make income. Scott Alexander even did some worldbuilding and fiction with Raikoth and Unsong. There was a Reddit thread where SSC readers were discussing a Quillette article. The article described Scott as a "philosopher-king". Commenters didn't like this over-aggrandizement of Scott; maybe see him as just "an interesting quirky guy with a blog". That's what I want to be. Maybe some day that path could me back into debate in a more healthy direction.

I don't even want to talk about my political phone call with my dad. I got so angry. I guess it was a fun final flare out. I'm done with debating politics. It's stupid and pointless. Devon Zuegel was right:
> Mainstream politics are an intellectual black hole. Many of the _topics_ people debate in mainstream politics are deeply important to making the world a better place, but the actual debates themselves are more performative than transformative. I try to avoid them and instead focus on taking action on the issues I think I can impact directly.

I should take her advice. More video games. More music. More reading. More art. More food. More fun. More creating. Less time on stupid political screaming matches. Fuck this entire world. So far it's gone well. We'll see how well it continues to go. Today I woke up in bed, cuddled with Deanna, read a bit about worldbuilding, ate waffles, got up, read about some things, called my dad, talked about shit as my last political debate, talked with Deanna about Christmas and other random things, ate a poptart, played Melvor Idle, went on a walk, and now I'm writing this.

Things I'm thinking about:
- How my debate with my dad went. I got too angry. That's why I'm not in politics anymore.
- What should my first worldbuilding project be? I'm thinking about a city.
- Making a game?
- Melvor Idle.
- Minecraft.
- Building a PC and getting a gaming console.
