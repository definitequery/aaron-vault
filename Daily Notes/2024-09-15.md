The phrase "Trump Derangement Syndrome" is only used by midwits, ideologues, and unserious grifters. The tactic is remarkably simple: engage in despicable and unjustifiable behavior, then paint anyone who criticizes you as "deranged" and blinded by their bias. This way, the burden is shifted to the person criticizing you to defend why they're not deranged, rather than you to justify the unjustifiable. It's thought-terminating and therefore appeals to those who'd rather not think.
