**Quen Rock Company**
The **Quen Rock Company** (**QRC**) is a chartered conglomerate trading company. The company was formed in 402 UEC by the Huldraric Parliament and has since expanded its influence into metals, livestock, lantern oil, and exotic spices.

In 382 UEC, cartographers surveying the Northern Peaks found an active quint fault in the upper cliffs of the mountains. The Huldraric Parliament sought to profit from the burgeoning quint trade in the Northern Peaks and, using their influence in the Frost People Colonial Governments, conglomerated local mining guilds into a large enterprise under Elven administration, chartering the new company in 402 UEC in the town of Nordinskold.

Elven citizenry worldwide can profit from the proceeds of the company, provided they are registered members of the Society of High Huldrary and citizens of the Blanchen Republic. The company has come under recent competition from Ulrezari startups that have mimicked Huldaric Elf quint-sensitivity with low-cost machinery.
