### The Rise of the Night
Long ago, in the eastern reaches of Tasvaran, there rose a vast kingdom. Its people were fierce and ambitious, and under the rule of its mighty king, the empire expanded relentlessly. Village after village fell to its armies, swelling the empire's borders and solidifying its ruler’s belief that he was destined to become the Eternal Emperor of all Tasvaran.

The kingdom prided itself on its rejection of magic and mana, branding them as unnatural corruptions of humanity. Strength, courage, and the ingenuity of man were the only acceptable means of power. Yet, as dominion grew, so too did discontent. Assimilation proved increasingly problematic, as the king showed no interest in forging unity among his conquered peoples. Regional governors, chafing and resentful under the king's bureaucracy, saw the royal family as self-serving tyrants, refusing to govern with unity or fairness.

Within the royal court, dissatisfaction simmered as well. The king’s sons, once united in admiration of their father, had grown envious and bitter, waiting for him to step aside. But the old king clung stubbornly to his throne, trusting no one, especially not his heirs. Of his sons, **Prince Kyrn** stood apart—quiet, cunning, and rebellious. Unlike his father, Kyrn saw the rejection of magic as a self-imposed limitation. Spells and eldritch forces were not abominations but tools to crush enemies and elevate himself to greatness.

In secret, Kyrn delved into forbidden studies, piecing together scraps of arcane knowledge stolen from defeated foes. His isolation and ambition left him vulnerable to darker influences. One night, in the stillness of his chamber, a voice from the empty space between dimensions whispered to him. It called itself **Ul’zaar**, a being of unfathomable hunger and power. It offered him power beyond imagination, power his father would never give. It promised to teach him magic no mortal could comprehend. All this was to be Kyrn's in exchange for a pact: the prince would summon the god’s heart into the world, an act requiring a heart as strong as steel, the blood of a king, and a blade forged in treachery.

Kyrn, his mind clouded by jealousy and resentment, accepted. His descent into darkness began with a trip to the dungeons beneath the royal palace. In the blackened depths, he found his victim: a warrior from a defiant kingdom crushed long ago by his father’s conquests. The guards warned Kyrn of the prisoner’s strength and hatred for the crown, but Kyrn dismissed them with a cold command. Alone, he entered the cell, his magic hidden beneath a veneer of arrogance.

The prisoner, upon recognizing Kyrn, erupted in fury, cursing the prince and his bloodline. But he was no match for Kyrn’s dark power. The prince summoned unseen tendrils of eldritch energy, choking the warrior’s rage into silence. With ritual precision, Kyrn tore the heart from the man’s chest and used the blood to etch an unholy sigil into the cold stone floor.

As Kyrn chanted the words learned through his dark scholarship, the air grew heavy, the chamber darkened, and reality itself seemed to tremble. From the void, **Ul’zaar’s Heart** emerged—a pulsating mass of blackened, otherworldly flesh, radiating an aura of insatiable hunger.

With Ul’zaar’s heart in hand, Kyrn set his plan into motion. He wielded the heart’s power to forge a blade of unholy might, its edge capable of severing both flesh and spirit, binding souls to the darkness. Knowing his brothers coveted the throne as much as he did, he used their ambitions against them. One by one, he lured his brothers into isolated confrontations. The first fell in a duel, framed as a tragic accident. The second was ambushed in his chambers, the murder blamed on a spy from the resistance.

When the third brother vanished, Kyrn spun a tale of conspiracy, planting evidence that implicated the resistance and regional governors. The king, already paranoid, fell deeper into mistrust. His grief over his sons’ deaths turned into fury, and he cracked down on the governors and their territories, accusing them of harboring traitors. His decrees were brutal, demanding higher tributes and forcing local leaders to execute those suspected of sedition.

The king’s actions ignited rebellion. The governors, enraged by the accusations and endless demands, secretly aligned themselves with the resistance, who now saw an opportunity to overthrow the old tyrant. As unrest spread, Kyrn positioned himself as the only son loyal to the throne. He feigned outrage at the rebellion and offered his father his unyielding support, all while working in the shadows to manipulate both sides.

Kyrn met with the leaders of the rebellion in secret, promising to aid their cause and depose his father. He portrayed himself as a visionary who sought to end the empire’s stagnation and tyranny. The governors agreed, forming a pact with Kyrn to launch a coordinated coup.

On the night of the coup, the rebels stormed the palace, and chaos erupted. Kyrn led them directly into the throne room, where the old king awaited. But as the battle unfolded, Kyrn revealed his true intentions. He unleashed the full power of Ul’zaar’s blade, its void-forged edge consuming the rebels’ souls. Tendrils of dark energy erupted from the sigil he had inscribed, ensnaring both the resistance leaders and the king.

With the blade in hand, Kyrn drove it through his father’s chest, pinning him to the throne. The blood of the king and the fallen rebels flowed into the sigil, completing Ul’zaar’s ritual. The throne room warped, becoming a nexus of eldritch power. Kyrn's body itself warped too, twisting his flesh and bone in the dark god's image. In his last moments, as the baleful god laughed in the recesses of his mind, Kyrn knew he had been deceived, but it was far too late.  Ul’zaar was reborn in the world through the prince's body.

Under Ul'zaar rule, the empire became a twisted theocracy. Citizens were bound to the will of the god of destruction, their mortal forms sacrificed in rituals glorifying the god, only to be reclaimed from the void and brought back as twisted hordes. His hellish clergy spin dark books of propaganda and shadow, sacrificing prisoners to the shadowy firmament.

To this day, his rule endures, now known across Tasvaran as **The Night**. His unholy visage is immortalized across the kingdom in grotesque monuments. The sigil of Ul’zaar burns in the hearts of his subjects, a reminder that their lives, their deaths, and their very souls belong to the god who rules as the Eternal King.
