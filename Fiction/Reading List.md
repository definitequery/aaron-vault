[Dune by Frank Herbert](http://amzn.to/1O01zZs)
A grand tale of wars and power struggles in the desert planet of Arrakis. Fantastic and imaginative world building.

[The Foundation Saga](http://amzn.to/1FwXX94)
The great psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted that the empire will fall. A small foundation must be established to preserve and rebuild civilization. The book has a great premise and a fun, engaging story. It is more of a young adult fiction book, as the characters are simple, and the worldview is quite naive (I feel much harm has been done by academics that try to do psychohistory in real life). But overall, it has lots of interesting ideas, and is a fun, fast read.

[Wool and the rest of the Silo Series by Hugh Howey](http://amzn.to/1PdPziW) 
An original tale, an intriguing and mysterious world, fascinating ideas, realistic and complex characters, and strong pacing that keeps you turning the page – this series is everything you could want from a work of fiction.

[Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe](http://amzn.to/1KD7jHT)
A Wall Street bond salesman in the go-go 1980s runs into trouble when he is involved in a hit-and-run with a black teenager. This fictional story explores the themes of many news stories of the last few years, ranging from the corruption in Wall Street finance to the eruptions over the shooting of Trayvon Martin. But this book gets all the more credit for being written *decades before those events happened*. Tom Wolfe is an author who does his homework. He sat alongside bond-traders as research for the novel. The result is a fictional story that provides a window into real world dynamics.

[Song of Fire and Ice (A Game of Thrones)](http://amzn.to/1Qn9yOp)
Two things to love about these books: First, when somebody does something stupid that should get themselves killed, they actually die. Second, the perils and pitfalls of leadership are portrayed in full. Unlike in most fantasy, a king does not have power simply by the fact of holding the scepter and having the title king. Maintaining the allegiance of vassals, building alliances, not being deceived by the courtiers – all these are part of the precarious and unending task of leadership. The books are also a good yarn of wars, magic, and dragons. Unfortunately, the novels lose steam after book three, at which point I stopped reading.

[Fable of the Dragon Tyrant](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html)
A short parable written as a metaphor for aging and advocating to fight against it.
