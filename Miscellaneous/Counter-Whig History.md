From Devin Helton...

In America, we are heirs to [Whig history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history). The Whig interpretation of history is a four hundred year narrative in which Western civilization progressed from the darkness of monarchy, aristocracy, stasis, inequality, bigotry, and anti-empiricism, toward a world of freedom, democracy, progress, equality, and scientific enlightenment. All mainstream history today is Whig history. Even conservative history, as interpreted by the National Review or Heritage Foundation, is 99% Whig history, with only dissent when it comes to the most recent events and revisionism. For instance, no mainstream conservative is openly on the side of the Tories or Loyalists on the question of the American Revolution.

Not only is Whig history the official narrative, we rarely even read the views of the non-Whigs. Whether we take a typical AP History class or endure the [Yale Directed Studies survey course](http://directedstudies.yale.edu/historical-political-thought), we do not read what the losers and reactionaries had to say.

One hypothesis is that the Whigs were in fact the good guys, and good has consistently prevailed over evil. A second hypothesis is that the Whigs were almost always the bad guys, and that evil routinely triumphs over good, and then writes histories to make their faction not seem so evil. A third hypothesis is that sometimes the Whigs were the good guys, sometimes they were the bad guys. Sometimes they won, sometimes they did not. But whoever won wrote the history books, and painted themselves as good guys, painted themselves as the friends of liberty and equality, painted themselves as heirs to the Whig tradition, whether it was true or not.

If you genuinely love history, I encourage you to sample some readings from the other side, the losers, the non-Whigs. As you read, keep the all three hypotheses above in mind. On events ranging from the English Civil War, to the American Revolution, to World War I, to the Red Scare, it is time to hear the other side of the story, the side of the story that you never before read. You may end up eventually renewing your faith in Whig-history – but at least by reading the other side your views will now be in full color. You will have replaced the cartoon version of history’s bad guys with a three-dimensional version.

### **The Counter-Whig history tour guides**

Our starting place for counter-whig history is the blog [Unqualified Reservations](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/), written by a pseudonymous character by the name of Mencius Moldbug. Moldbug grew up with inside knowledge of American government – his father worked in the foreign service, his mother was a high official in the energy department, his step-dad was a Capitol Hill staffer. After success at a startup, he took a multi-year sabbatical, during which he spent $500 a month on old books. During this period, he single-handedly created the field of counter-whig studies.

Here are some of his posts that are most approachable. Be warned, some people find Mencius too long-winded, and find that he makes too many weird sci-fi references. If you find him unreadable, perhaps try one of the books from the *General Counter-Whig History* series below:

### **Foseti’s Books Reviews**

A second tour guide is the [blogger Foseti](https://foseti.wordpress.com/). The best way to sample him is by doing a [google search for book reviews on his web site](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afoseti.wordpress.com+book+review&oq=site%3Afoseti.wordpress.com+book+review), and then picking through ones that seem interesting.

### **General Counter-Whig Histories**

[Holy Madness by Adam Zamoyski](http://amzn.to/1FwXTq5)

The fall of traditional religion during the enlightenment opened up a new world of radical idealists who wished to build utopias on Earth. This books tells the story of over a dozen revolutions that took place in the Western world from 1770 to 1870. The utter insanity of the time period shows the dark side of The Enlightenment and the Romantic Era.

[Understanding Human History by Michael Hart](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hart_-_understanding_human_history-1.pdf)

You have probably read Jared Diamond’s *Guns, Germs and Steel*. At the very least you have been marinated in his ideas. Diamond uses pure geography to explain why some civilizations have beat out other civilizations. Michael Hart’s explanation is much more politically incorrect and thus you will never find his book in college book stores or your local library. You can read both Hart and Diamond, and come to your own decision about which scholar’s view seems more compelling.

[Popular Government by Henry Sumner Maine](https://archive.org/details/populargovernme01maingoog)

Written by a 19th century British jurist and historian, this book is an analysis and critique of democratic government. His view is that outside of Britain and America, democracy has been an unstable and ephemeral form of government.

[Liberty or Equality by Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn](https://mises.org/library/liberty-or-equality-challenge-our-time)

Kuehnelt-Leddihn marshals the strongest possible case that democratic equality is the very basis not of liberty, as is commonly believed, but the total state. He uses national socialism as his prime example. He further argues the old notion of government by law is upheld in old monarchies, restrained by a noble elite. Aristocracy, not democracy, gave us liberty.

[Leftism: From de Sade and Marx to Hitler and Marcuse](https://mises.org/library/leftism-de-sade-and-marx-hitler-and-marcuse)

“Kuehnelt seeks to redefine the political spectrum. His background as an Austrian nobleman gives him a perspective on politics that is very different and unique compared with the vast majority of Americans. Kuehnel also openly writes from a Roman Catholic viewpoint and pro-Christian viewpoint. He defines as ”leftist“ as any movement that emphasizes ”identitarianism“ (i.e. sameness) and either the total rule of the state or ”the will of the people“ over the populace’s affairs.”

[On power, its nature and the history of its growth by Bertrand de Jouvenel](https://archive.org/details/onpoweritsnature00injouv)

Jouvenel frames history as a conflict between centralized power and local power. The essential conflict is the high (central power) promising the masses that it can free them from the oppression of the middle (aristocrats, Church, clan authority, village leaders, etc.) But when central power wins, the masses find themselves with a new master, and one that is not necessarily better.

[The Machiavellians by James Burham](https://archive.org/details/TheMachiavellians)

Burham argues that it is the cynics and realists who protect freedom – not the naive idealists.
