[Out of Bondage by Elizabeth Bentley](https://archive.org/details/BentleyElizabethOutOfBondage)
The memoirs of an American communist agent, who was involved in conspiracies at the highest level. This is a riveting real-life spy tale. It tells a history that is often ignored – there was in fact a communist conspiracy, and it did touch the highest levels of American government.

[Chronicles of Wasted Time by Malcolm Muggeridge](https://archive.org/details/MuggeridgeMalcolmChroniclesOfWastedTime)
Muggeridge had a front row seat to the great events of the 20th Century. He hob nobbed in high places in British society, was a foreign correspondant in Stalin’s Russia, traveled through Nazi Germany, and fought in the British military during war. His story is one of continual disillusionment with his previous socialist ideals.

[Radical Son by David Horowitz](http://amzn.to/1PhArDK)
Horowitz went to Berkeley, published Ramparts and published other progressive works with Peter Collier. He also fell in with the Black Panthers and particularly with Huey Newton. Soon, his political transformation. As he tells it in the book, the transformation was essentially a realization that the New Left was no different than the Old Left. If there was one turning point for Horowitz, it came when the Panthers killed his friend (and Panther member) Betty Van Porter. Just as the Old Left protected horrible crimes, so was the New Left.

[Radical Chic and Mau Mauing the Catch-flakkers by Tom Wolfe](http://amzn.to/1PhAu2y)
“These are two long essays dealing with Race in America in the late 1960’s. Radical Chic is the more famous of the two. Imagine the scene as Leonard Bernstien and his wife throw a cocktail party in their posh Manhattan Apartment with members of the Black Panther Party as the guests of honor. Wolfe was present at this strange event and offers a play by play of how Radical became all the Chic in the New York social scene…briefly.”

[Memoirs of a Superfluous Man by Albert J. Nock](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/nockmemoirs.pdf)
“Albert Jay Nock, perhaps the most brilliant American essayist of the 20th century, and certainly among its most important libertarian thinkers, set out to write his autobiography but he ended up doing much more. He presents here a full theory of society, state, economy, and culture, and does so almost inadvertently.”

[Detroit an American Autopsy by Charlie LeDuff](http://amzn.to/1PhAnUB)
“Back in his broken hometown, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Charlie LeDuff searches through the ruins for clues to its fate, his family’s, and his own. Detroit is where his mother’s flower shop was firebombed in the pre-Halloween orgy of arson known as Devil’s Night; where his sister lost herself to the west side streets; where his brother, who once sold subprime mortgages with skill and silk, now works in a factory cleaning Chinese-manufactured screws so they can be repackaged as ‘May Be Made in United States.’”

[Slaughter of the Cities by Michael Jones](http://amzn.to/1QnDKr1)
From the 1940s through the 1990s, many of the major cities in America lost half their population, and often 60-90% of their white population. What happened? Michael Jones writes an account of the minority WASP elite using urban renewal to break up white ethnic neighborhoods, and destroy Catholic ethnics as a political power.

[It Didn’t Start At Watergate](https://archive.org/details/LaskyVictorItDidntStartWithWatergate)
“The press has been, and still is, more likely to cover the failings of their ideological opponents. As Lasky continually illustrates, media favorites were seldom scrutinized and never were these miscreants taken to task. Documented throughout with private testimony, Commitee testimony, news accounts and some government agency reports, Lasky’s reportage dips far back into the vindictive actions of Franklin Roosevelt. We are led through the Truman administration into both the unethical and illegal acts of the Kennedys. Finally capping this accounting of dirty tricks with a near out of control LBJ. Many of the lesser participants are studied.”

[Behemoth by Thomas Hobbes](https://archive.org/details/behemothorlongp00hobbgoog)
“The dialogue opens with the student asking the master how it was that a monarch as strong as Charles I should ever have had to face a rebellion. The master relates that a growing opposition to the crown was promoted by seven factions, each of them for their own ends and not in concert, who stoked the fires of rebellion. These factions were: Papists, Presbyterians, Independents including other sects of religious faith, those who were corrupted by their reading of the Latin and Greek classics, centres of commerce and trade such as London, those with no means of support who saw the war as a way to profit, and the lack of understanding as to the important role played by the monarchy in society.”

[True History of the American Revolution by Sydney George Fisher](https://archive.org/details/truehistoryofthe010276mbp)
Written in 1906, it presents the history of the American Revolution from a more even-handed perspective than I am used to reading. The resulting history is more believable than the classic story and, in many ways, more interesting. The most interesting aspect of the “true” history is that Mr Fisher paints the struggle which we commonly view as between England and America as a struggle between Whigs and Tories. Initially, the English troops were led by General Howe, while the navy was led by his brother, Admiral Howe. Both were committed Whigs. Whigs, at the time, were sympathetic to American independence. Chapter 8, on the American Reign of Terror, is also fascinating reading, as this part of history is normally left out of the civics class version.

[Democracy and the Party System in the United States by Moisey Ostrogorsky](https://archive.org/details/cu31924030482719)
There is a lot of myth-making about our great democratic traditions in America. This colorful account of democratic politics in the 19th century shows that the truth about democracy was very different than the civics class version.

[Shall Cromwell have a statue?](https://archive.org/details/shallcromwellhav00adam) and [Tis Sixty Years Since](https://archive.org/details/tissixtyyearssin00adam) by Charles Francis Adams Jr.
Charles Francis Adams Jr.’s bio includes: being born the grandson of president John Quincy Adams; graduating from Harvard, fighting in the civil war on the side of the Union; earning the rank of colonel; running the Union Pacific Railroad; chairing the Massachusetts Park Commission; and serving as president of the American Historical Association. These two pieces describe his reflections and views on the Civil War, with the perspective of many decades gone by.

[Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made by Eugene Genovese](http://amzn.to/1PhAgZ8)
“In his best-known book Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (1974), Genovese examined the society of the slaves. This book won the national Bancroft Prize in History. Genovese viewed the antebellum South as a closed and organically united paternalist society that exploited and attempted to dehumanize the slaves. Genovese paid close attention to the role of religion as a form of resistance in the daily life of the slaves because slaves used it to give themselves a sense of humanity. He placed paternalism at the center of the master-slave relationship. Both masters and slaves embraced paternalism, though for different reasons and with varying notions of what paternalism meant.”

[Reconstruction in South Carolina by Daniel Chamberlain](http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0087-4;didno=atla0087-4;view=image;seq=00481;node=atla0087-4%3A1)
A southern view of reconstruction written in 1901. Chamberlain denounces reconstruction as being the act of partisans and selfish politicans, who wished to use corrupt means to buy the black vote, looted the state treasuries, and tried to ensure a permanent national Republican majority.
