## Early 20th Century - Ottoman Rule to French Mandate

- During World War I, the Ottoman Empire entered the conflict as a Central Power. It ultimately suffered defeat and loss of control of the entire Near East to the British Empire and French Empire
- During the conflict, genocide against indigenous Christian peoples was carried out by the Ottomans and their allies in the form of the Armenian genocide and Assyrian genocide, of which Deir ez-Zor in Ottoman Syria was the final destination of these death marches

**1916**: Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 - secret agreement between Britain and France dividing Ottoman territories
- Secret treaty between United Kingdom and France to define spheres of influence and control in eventual partition of Ottoman Empire.
- Based on the premise that the Triple Entente would defeat the Ottomans in World War I.


**1920**: 
- In 1920, a short-lived independent Kingdom of Syria was established under Faisal I of the Hashemite family
- French troops occupied Syria later that year after the San Remo conference proposed that the League of Nations put Syria under a French mandate

## French Mandate Period

**1925-1927**: In 1925, Sultan al-Atrash led a revolt that broke out in the Druze Mountain and spread to engulf the whole of Syria and parts of Lebanon - Great Syrian Revolt against French rule

**1936**: Syria and France negotiated a treaty of independence in September 1936

**1940-1946**: 
- With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of Vichy France until the British and Free French occupied the country in the Syria-Lebanon campaign in July 1941
- Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalists and the British forced the French to evacuate their troops in April 1946

## Independence and Political Instability

**1945**: It gained de jure independence as a parliamentary republic in 1945 when the First Syrian Republic became a founding member of the United Nations

**1948**: In May 1948, Syrian forces invaded Palestine, together with other Arab states - First Arab-Israeli War

**1949**: Defeat in this war was one of several trigger factors for the March 1949 Syrian coup d'Ã©tat by Colonel Husni al-Za'im, described as the first military overthrow of the Arab World since the start of the Second World War

**1949-1954**: Series of military coups and counter-coups

## United Arab Republic and Ba'ath Party Rise

**1958**: On 1 February 1958, Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli and Egypt's Nasser announced the merging of Egypt and Syria, creating the United Arab Republic

**1961**: Syria seceded from the union with Egypt on 28 September 1961, after a coup and terminated the political union

**1963**: The 8 March 1963 Ba'athist coup. The takeover was engineered by members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party

**2005**: In 2005, Syria ended its military presence in Lebanon. Assassination of Rafic Hariri in 2005 led to international condemnation and triggered a popular Intifada in Lebanon, known as "the Cedar Revolution", which forced the Assad regime to end its 29-year-old military occupation in Lebanon

## Syrian Civil War Era

**2011**: Public demonstrations across Syria began on 26 January 2011 and developed into a nationwide uprising. Protesters demanded the resignation of Assad, the overthrow of his government, and an end to nearly five decades of Ba'ath Party rule
