[Outline of History by H.G. Wells](https://archive.org/details/OutlineOfHistory)
A history of the world from the beginning of time until the end of World War I. If you have big gaps in your basic historical knowledge, reading the relevant chapters of this book is a quick way to fill them in. The prose and structure is a lot more engaging than a typical wikipedia article. It tells history as a story, rather than a set of facts.

[Understanding Human History by Michael Hart](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/hart_-_understanding_human_history-1.pdf)
You have probably read Jared Diamond’s *Guns, Germs and Steel*. At the very least you have been marinated in his ideas. Diamond uses pure geography to explain why some civilizations have beat out other civilizations. Michael Hart’s explanation is much more politically incorrect and thus you will never find his book in college book stores or your local library. You can read both Hart and Diamond, and come to your own decision about which scholar’s view seems more compelling.

[Robbery Under Law by Evelyn Waugh](https://archive.org/details/WaughEvelynRobberyUnderLawTheMexicanObjectLesson)
Written in 1939, Waugh describes the descent of Mexico into a third-world mess. “So party politics were introduced with pleasant expectations of candidates competing with benevolent projects and a party loyalty finding expression in coloured rosettes and rotten eggs. The result has been twenty-five years of graft, bloodshed and bankruptcy.”
## Ancient Greece
[*The Illiad*](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-Penguin-Classics-Homer/dp/0140445927)
Composed in archaic Greece, _The Iliad_ is a furious meditation on honor, ego, and divine meddling. What begins as a quarrel over a captive girl spirals into a parade of senseless heroics, petty vengeance, and gods treating mortals like chess pieces. By the end, glory is drenched in blood, and nobody seems much the wiser.

[*The Odyssey*](https://www.amazon.com/Odyssey-Penguin-Classics-Homer/dp/0140449116)
Written a generation later, _The Odyssey_ charts the endlessly delayed homecoming of a war hero who offends every monster, sorceress, and god he meets. What should be a quick sail turns into a decade-long detour of lies, shipwrecks, and self-congratulation. By the time he returns, half his crew is dead, his house is overrun, and he's still bragging about that wooden horse.

[*Theogony* and *Works and Days*](https://www.amazon.com/Hesiod-Theognis-Penguin-Classics-Theogony/dp/0140442839)
_The Theogony_ is Hesiod’s attempt to catalog a divine family tree riddled with incest, cannibalism, and cosmic grudges. The universe is born, gods overthrow gods in grim succession, and Zeus rises to power mostly by not being quite as awful as his predecessors. Order, such as it is, emerges from chaos—but only just.

_Works and Days_ is Hesiod’s scolding letter to his lazy brother, thinly disguised as a moral handbook. It blends divine fables, almanac advice, and bitter rants about injustice into a rough manual for surviving a hard world where the gods rarely reward virtue, and the only real answer is to shut up and get back to work.
