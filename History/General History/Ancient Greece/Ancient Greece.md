Hippias, a tyrant, ruled Athens jointly with his brother Hipparchus. Hipparchus was assassinated in 514 BC, leaving Hippias to rule alone.

Cleomenes I overthrows Hippias, installing Spartan oligarchy led by Isagoras, a rival of Cleisthenes. Exiled Cleisthenes from the city, until Athenians pushed them to the Acropolis and forced a truce.

Athens sends troops to aid the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule, provoking two Persian invasions of Greece.
- First revolt repelled at the Battle of Marathon
- Second revolt repelled at the naval battle of Salamis after the Battle of Thermopylae and the sacrifice of Spartan King Leonidas I. Final land battle was the Battle of Plataea.
