Foseti writes: “I’ve been searching for good history books on India or China for a long time. This book is the first one I’ve read that I would call good. The book is a history of the end of British rule in India and the creation of the modern states of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The story is told through people: Mountbatten, Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah (possibly Patel, as well) are the main characters whom the story revolves around.”
