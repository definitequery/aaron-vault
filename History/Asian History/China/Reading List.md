[China in World History by S A M Adshead, Reshmi Dutta-Flanders](http://amzn.to/2oxUBAS)
A history of China much heavier on “insight porn” rather than tedious details. Recommended by one of the biggest China experts that I know.

[The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers](https://www.amazon.com/Party-Secret-Chinas-Communist-Rulers/dp/0061708771)
The Party is Financial Times reporter Richard McGregor’s eye-opening investigation into China’s Communist Party, and the integral role it has
played in the country’s rise as a global superpower and rival to the United States. Many books have examined China’s economic rise, human rights record,
turbulent history, and relations with the U.S.; none until now, however, have tackled the issue central to understanding all of these issues: how the ruling
communist government works. The Party delves deeply into China’s secretive political machine.

_[Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China](https://amzn.to/2Cxdnm0)_ 
This is a biography of Deng Xiaoping, but the largest chunk is devoted to the period between 1978-1989, the period in which he formulated and then implemented the policies that would shape China’s economic future. Deng is a very interesting figure in the Chinese Communist Party, having no ideological objections to private enterprise. Though he never implemented a democratic system, it is interesting to see how much more free the PRC was during his time in power, something that has regressed substantially in recent years; despite this, he was a devoted member of the communist party, something that was ultimately a problem for Chinese citizens, since he never was willing to do away with the authoritarian government. You can’t help but ask “what if?” in regards to a continued democratization with Deng. At any rate, this biography does a great job of showing the state of China during the time Deng Xiaoping was involved in government.
