[World War I as Fulfillment: Power and the Intellectuals by Murray Rothbard](https://mises.org/system/tdf/9_1_5_0.pdf?file=1&type=document)
“It is not an exaggeration to say that the progressive movement during the late 1800s and early 1900s was the story of an insane religious cult taking over the American institutions of power. Murray Rothbard makes a compelling case.”

[Road to War 1914-1917 by Walter Millis](https://archive.org/details/MillisWalterRoadToWarAmerica19141917)
Walter Millis worked mainly as a newspaperman for the New York Herald Tribune, and wrote books about current affairs, especially world conflicts. In this book he looks at the United States from the time war was declared in Europe in 1914 up until the time the US got involved in the fighting herself. He doesn’t much like what he sees. Although America declared neutrality at the beginning of hostilities in Europe, she was actually supporting the side of the Entente (England, France, Italy) from the start. Thus, while most of the country didn’t want America in the war and President Wilson had promised to keep the country out of it, because the country had from the beginning “chosen one side over the other,” she was inextricably drawn in.

[How Diplomats Make War by Francis Neilson](https://mises.org/library/how-diplomats-make-war)
This was written by a member of the British Parliament in 1915. He resigned shortly after publishing it. “Neilson’s thesis was that Germany didn’t bear some unique guilt for the war; there was plenty of blame to go around, but ultimately its rests with the arms buildup and secret diplomacy of Britain. His reconstruction of the history of 19th-century diplomacy provides incredible detail to fill out this thesis, even as he never loses sight of the big picture.”
